            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <l>With Vengeance, Zeal and wrath to reſcue Zion.</l>

                  <l>Zion's here taken in a Goſpel ſence:</l>
                  <l>Not for that holy mount where temple ſtood,</l>
                  <l>That city guiltie of Chriſts precious blood,</l>
                  <l>Or that deſcent from Abraham's fleſhly ſeed,</l>

                  <l>By circumciſion Paſſover and Rites</l>

                  <l>Who caſts them all into the ſecond death:</l>
                  <l>Where endleſs night begins, and no more day.</l>
                  <l>But Zion's night there ends, (who watch and pray.)</l>
                  <l>Now comes the change, where tables quite are turn'd.</l>

                  <l>How ſlippery a thing is our Salvation?</l>
                  <l>If Jeſus Chriſt doth not as faſt lay hold</l>

                  <l>Upon this tikliſh earthly theater.</l>
                  <l>The firſt are all the progenie of Adam,</l>
                  <l>Who do not yet the depths of Satan fadom:</l>
                  <l>Nor yet can numb'red be with ſuch as thoſe,</l>

                  <l>While they are under goſpel viſitation,</l>
                  <l>And therewithall Satans inſinuation:</l>
                  <l>It is not yet concluded one or other,</l>
                  <l>By which they ſhall be conquer'd, or giv'n over.</l>
                  <l>But when to either ſide they are made faſt,</l>
                  <l>By faith in Chriſt: Or by Chriſt overpaſt,</l>
                  <l>And left unto the hardneſs of their heart:</l>
                  <l>The day of grace is out, they have no part</l>
                  <l>Nor lot amongſt thoſe which are his redeem'd,</l>
                  <l>How high ſoever in mens eyes eſteem'd.</l>
                  <l>But they that heartily make Chriſt their head,</l>
                  <l>(And he accepts the cloſe which they have made)</l>
                  <l>Are kept for ever by his mighty arm,</l>
                  <l>Shall never wholly fall or ſuffer harm.</l>
                  <l>It griev's me oft to think how ſome deride,</l>

                  <l>Now Chriſts true members; then the limbs o'th' beaſt.</l>
                  <l>So long as we in ſtate of nature are,</l>
                  <l>(Some Judge) we children are of Lucifer:</l>
                  <l>And that it's all alike, where Scripture ſaith:</l>
                  <l>We all by nature children are of wrath.</l>
                  <l>That their condition is no whit more evil,</l>
                  <l>Whom Chriſt pronounceth children of the devil.</l>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47983:26"/>
                  <l>To which opinion I can no more cloſe</l>

                  <l>Who ſtifly do maintain (Alas for ſorrow)</l>
                  <l>Gods child to day may Satans be to morrow.</l>
                  <l>Indeed by nature we are Satans ſlaves,</l>
                  <l>And he amongſt us and within us raves,</l>
                  <l>And like a ſtrong man arm'd, keep's in his hands,</l>
                  <l>And holds us faſt, yet tyrant-like commands,</l>
                  <l>And yet with ſubtiltie, by ſeeming guiſe,</l>
                  <l>Makes us believe we are in Paradiſe,</l>
                  <l>Untill a ſtronger come that caſt's him out:</l>
                  <l>In places dry he wanders then about,</l>
                  <l>But when he's out on's hous, he hath no reſt,</l>
                  <l>Untill again he be admitted gueſt;</l>
                  <l>With 7 fold force he comes toth' houſe he left,</l>
                  <l>But painted finds it, empty, ſwept, bereft</l>
                  <l>Of ſuch a power as caſt the tyrant out,</l>
                  <l>And forced him to wander round about.</l>
                  <l>But that great power not receiv'd to dwell;</l>
                  <l>This enters: makes that ſoul the child of hell.</l>
                  <l>And now this houſe, become ſo deſolate,</l>
                  <l>Is given over to be reprobate.</l>
                  <l>Becaus the evil ſp'rit caſt out by Chriſt,</l>
                  <l>Now's entertain'd: The laſt end's wors than firſt.</l>
                  <l>The ſum is this: That what at firſt was fickle,</l>
                  <l>And not eſtabliſht, but in doubtfull pickle,</l>
                  <l>Is abſolute at laſt in better or wors ſtate,</l>
                  <l>Either praedeſtinate, or reprobate.</l>
                  <l>And thus we ſee the diff'rence of the ſtation,</l>
                  <l>Between the common and ſelect ſalvation.</l>
                  <l>The one hath means that will produce it's end,</l>
                  <l>Upon condition we thereto attend.</l>
                  <l>Th'other enters (at leaſt when we firſt know)</l>
                  <l>When Chriſt is entertain'd, and Satan parted fro.</l>
                  <l>And I appeal unto experience,</l>
                  <l>Who e'er could ſay, if ſpecial grace commence,</l>
                  <l>Before he entertain (and cleave to) Chriſt,</l>

                  <l>Although the dog will catch at childrens bread;</l>

                  <l>Where to begin, or where to make an end,</l>
                  <l>Or how to circumſcribe this crooked fiend</l>
                  <l>In all his workings in the heart of man,</l>
                  <l>Before the goſpel tidings firſt began.</l>
                  <l>Or till the Spirit ſomwhat doth impart</l>
                  <l>Of goſpel grace within unto the heart.</l>
                  <l>But that we may correct our methods-growth,</l>
                  <l>Take notice henceforth, this is but the fourth:</l>
                  <l>And that we may theſe ſteps the better fadom,</l>
                  <l>We muſt look back again toth' ſtate of Adam.</l>
                  <l>Where firſt the Serpent with his wily tricks</l>
                  <l>Prevail'd with man to kick againſt the pricks.</l>
                  <l>When man was innocent, and knew no ſin,</l>
                  <l>Then did the ſerpent firſt his craft begin</l>
                  <l>To vent his poyſon: feigning that the Lord</l>
                  <l>Had much deceiv'd man by his threatning word,</l>
                  <l>To keep preciſely to the given law,</l>
                  <l>And that he needed not to ſtand in aw.</l>
                  <l>And if we mark his crafty footſteps well,</l>
                  <l>It is the method which he uſeth ſtill.</l>
                  <l>There's not a man that lives, (that acts his reaſon)</l>
                  <l>But ſtill the ſerpent tempts him to this treaſon.</l>
                  <l>For as the Law before the Goſpel came,</l>
                  <l>There is that order in the very frame</l>
                  <l>That God hath plac'd in each mans conſcience,</l>
                  <l>That is a witneſs 'gainſt the Laws offence.</l>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47983:37"/>
                  <l>Nor is there one that e'er you heard or ſaw,</l>
                  <l>But firſt hath conſcience of a righteous law,</l>
                  <l>According to the means and diſpenſation</l>
                  <l>That God doth uſe in every place or nation.</l>
                  <l>Whether they have the written word or no,</l>
                  <l>They have a law, by which they ought to go.</l>
                  <l>And as the means are given and apply'd,</l>
                  <l>So have and ſhall their conſciences be try'd.</l>
                  <l>Take up a child; and you ſhall often hear,</l>
                  <l>He'l yield, 'tis bad to coſen, lie and ſwear.</l>
                  <l>To do to others, as we would to us</l>
                  <l>Should be intended: and men living thus</l>
                  <l>In heart and life; without deceit and guil</l>
                  <l>Is one great part of duty to fullfill.</l>
                  <l>There is another part which is the chief:</l>
                  <l>Duty to God, from whom we have our life,</l>
                  <l>Can help or hurt us, as it pleaſeth him.</l>
                  <l>Commands and threats reach conſciences betime.</l>
                  <l>And if there were no falſe inſinuation,</l>
                  <l>To tempt us from our duty, in relation</l>
                  <l>To God and man; we ſhould our maker love,</l>
                  <l>Worſhip and ſerve, ſincerely and above</l>
                  <l>All other things: and do our neighbour good</l>
                  <l>In word and deed; as our own fleſh and blood.</l>
                  <l>Now look what hurt us firſt, doth hurt us ſtill,</l>
                  <l>This ſerpent did and doth our fancies fill</l>
                  <l>With great deceit; obtrudes, upon us lies,</l>
                  <l>Rides over conſcience; tempts us to deſpiſe</l>
                  <l>The checks it gives: as if it was a bable,</l>
                  <l>And told us nothing but ſome lying fable.</l>
                  <l>And hence we find, we uſually commence</l>
                  <l>Againſt the Lord himſelf our firſt offence,</l>
                  <l>(As well as greateſt:) Almoſt every ſin</l>
                  <l>Doth with ſom ſlighting thoughts of God begin.</l>
                  <l>Let us but mind, how ſin doth firſt deceive.</l>
                  <l>The caſe is plain: as Satan cheated Eve.</l>
                  <l>Had God ſtood ſoveraign in the womans heart,</l>
                  <l>(Untainted there:) It was not Satans dart,</l>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47983:38"/>
                  <l>Nor his alluring her to hear and ſee,</l>
                  <l>That would have toucht her with the fruit or tree.</l>
                  <l>But once caſt of that aw, then every thing</l>
                  <l>Will to this kindled fire fewel bring;</l>
                  <l>Then what we ſee, hear, taſt, feel, touch, or ſmell,</l>
                  <l>Will preſently infect; and ſtink of hell.</l>
                  <l>Let's take a tryall in a known example,</l>
                  <l>Where't will appear to ſence more clear and ample.</l>
                  <l>Suppoſe a ſervant, thief, or any child</l>
                  <l>Should by ſome tempting baits be ſo beguild,</l>
                  <l>To covet ſomthing that is none of his;</l>
                  <l>And knows, in taking, he ſhall do amiſs.</l>
                  <l>What ever ſtops him (if that do appear)</l>
                  <l>The caſe is plain: he dare's not take't for fear.</l>
                  <l>But if he think there's none who can him ſee,</l>
                  <l>And none ſhall know (when ſtol'n) that it was he.</l>
                  <l>When fear is conquer'd, do's he care's not what.</l>
                  <l>As drunkards do; when they have got a pot.</l>
                  <l>'Tis Satans work fearleſs to make of ſin,</l>
                  <l>And that he may his purpoſe better win,</l>
                  <l>While ſin is baited he will hide the rod,</l>
                  <l>To make the ſinner caſt off fear of God.</l>
                  <l>And yet his methods are fear to create,</l>
                  <l>By ſundry fancies caſt into mans pate.</l>
                  <l>Never ſo ſenceleſs, fooliſh, vain, and odd,</l>
                  <l>Fear every thing; (and what you will:) but God.</l>
                  <l>For fear is good; as God did it create:</l>
                  <l>It's onely bad as 'tis inordinate.</l>
                  <l>Moſt hurtfull then and moſt of all debas't,</l>
                  <l>When on wrong objects ſet: not rightly plac't.</l>
                  <l>When man hath ſin'd, and conſcience call'd to tryal,</l>
                  <l>Then Satan tempts to make a flat denial.</l>
                  <l>In Sarahs caſe; when God conviction gave,</l>
                  <l>For laughing: ſaid right out; ſhee did not laugh.</l>
                  <l>The like did Saul: when Samuel reprov'd</l>
                  <l>Neglect of duty; which to him behov'd,</l>
                  <l>With Brazen face, did flatly to it ſtand,</l>
                  <l>He had obey'd Gods righteous command.</l>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:47983:38"/>
                  <l>At other times when conſcience ſhould be try'd,</l>
                  <l>Then Satan ſtrives and tempts the man to hide.</l>
                  <l>Makes him believe, in ſuch a caſe 'tis beſt</l>
                  <l>By any means to keep himſelf from teſt.</l>
                  <l>When mans reprov'd: rather than he will hear,</l>
                  <l>Like the deaf adder, he will ſtop his ear.</l>
                  <l>Thoſe wicked men were poiſon'd with this leaven,</l>
                  <l>That ſtopt their ears, juſt when they ſtoned Steven.</l>
                  <l>But when that fails: To cover ſins abuſes.</l>
                  <l>There are a thouſand ſhifts and vain excuſes,</l>
                  <l>Thus Adam Eve: and Eve the ſerpent blaim'd,</l>
                  <l>Fig-leavs muſt ſerve, leaſt naked parts be ſham'd.</l>
                  <l>But God is righteous, ſinners ſhall be dumb;</l>
                  <l>Have no relief, untill the goſpel come.</l>
                  <l>And Satan (by mans fault) brought in that flaw.</l>
                  <l>There's none upright: if judged by the law:</l>
                  <l>The Law accuſes; but did never quit</l>
                  <l>A ſoul from death, in Adams days: nor yet.</l>
                  <l>And therefore I proceed unto the fifth,</l>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <l>Where man condemn'd by law may get a lift.</l>
                  <l>'Ere I proceed, theſe two heads us adviſe</l>
                  <l>To think of Satan in a double guiſe.</l>
                  <l>The laſt declar'd his nature what he was.</l>
                  <l>This; what (in all depraved men) he do's.</l>
                  <l>And what he doth in man is alſo double,</l>
                  <l>I hope to ſearch, it may be worth our trouble.</l>
                  <l>The firſt is diſobedience to the law,</l>
                  <l>By which he wounds the conſcience, makes it raw:</l>
                  <l>Which if he cannot wholly cauterize,</l>
                  <l>Dawb, mince, excuſe, extenuate by lies,</l>
                  <l>He'l follow't cloſe; gall, laſh, ſcourge, chide and tear,</l>
                  <l>Make conſcience feel the fruit it cannot bear.</l>
                  <l>And for the Law-tranſgreſſion the Lord</l>
                  <l>Himſelf doth back it by his holy word,</l>
                  <l>Yea God and Satan (though in oppoſition)</l>
                  <l>Make conſcience feel the fruit of ſins commiſſion.</l>
                  <l>But God and Satan have quite diff'rent ends:</l>
                  <l>Satan, deſtruction, God, humbling intends:</l>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47983:39"/>
                  <l>That ſinners may prepared be for grace,</l>
                  <l>Which Satan ſtrives in man may take no place.</l>
                  <l>And that's the ſecond work by Satan us'd,</l>
                  <l>By which his venom (in our hearts infus'd)</l>
                  <l>Doth operate againſt the goſpel light,</l>
                  <l>With more enraged ſubtilty and ſpite.</l>
                  <l>But in the preſent head we that adjourn,</l>
                  <l>Untill we come toth' next, for there's its turn.</l>
                  <l>Mean-time we ſee, how Satan ſeeks the doom</l>
                  <l>Of out-law'd ſinners: e're the goſpel come.</l>
                  <l>And when once caſt he gives no ſpace to breath:</l>
                  <l>Becaus he knows they have deſerved death.</l>
                  <l>But all this while, ſo long as 'tis but law,</l>
                  <l>It can beyond firſt covenant terms not go.</l>
                  <l>As Adams caſe (before the goſpel came)</l>
                  <l>The law offended, judged by the ſame.</l>
                  <l>Look what the law had threatned, he incur'd,</l>
                  <l>His puniſhment was equal to the word:</l>
                  <l>And that was death, I freely do confeſs,</l>
                  <l>With each appurtenance, and nothing leſs.</l>
                  <l>But 'tis the firſt, and not the ſecond death,</l>
                  <l>Which is inflicted on all ſouls that breath.</l>
                  <l>The ſecond death is quite another thing,</l>
                  <l>Which goſpel wrath denounceth and doth bring,</l>

                  <l>There's no compare, ſee what the word doth ſay</l>
                  <l>Since Adams time: it is another caſe,</l>
                  <l>Goſpel as well as law now takes it's place.</l>
                  <l>You hardly can detect a ſin that doth</l>
                  <l>In one or more degrees not touch them both.</l>
                  <l>For every ſin doth violate the law,</l>
                  <l>But many ſins toth' goſpel do not ſo.</l>
                  <l>The goſpel pard'neth every ſin, but one:</l>
                  <l>Doth paſs by many: but indulgeth none.</l>

                  <l>As for example thoſe in th' Hebrews caſe</l>

                  <l>Some years ago a perſon diſcontent,</l>
                  <l>The devil did his carefull thoughts augment,</l>
                  <l>In human ſhape appear'd with gravity,</l>
                  <l>As if he pittied him, demanded why</l>

                  <l>He ſeem'd in doubt, but knew't was fortunes frown,</l>
                  <l>His mind was much too big for's preſent ſtate,</l>
                  <l>Look't not to God, and ſo grew deſperate.</l>
                  <l>This Grave Impoſtor promis'd full ſupply</l>
                  <l>And preſent riddance of his miſery,</l>
                  <l>And for ſo many years without controle,</l>
                  <l>But he muſt bargain with him for his ſoul.</l>
                  <l>The contract's made, the paper ſign'd and ſeal'd,</l>
                  <l>But by the grace of God in time repeal'd.</l>
                  <l>Conſcience grew hot, and checkt for what was don,</l>
                  <l>But knew not how to break the threed he'd ſpun.</l>
                  <l>Some Chriſtian friends by ſearching much about,</l>

                  <l>And (as I heard) was after circumſpect,</l>

                  <l>And rather choſe in Gods hand to expire,</l>

                  <l>To make up reck'nings, and to buy more cloth,</l>
                  <l>(Which was his trade) provided was for both.</l>
                  <l>So riding (with his charge) took up at night,</l>

                  <l>And praid his gueſt to keep the key, that when</l>
                  <l>He ſaw his time, mgiht take it out again.</l>
                  <l>(They both agreed) he lodged there all night,</l>

                  <l>Took up his charge, paid coſts, and went his way.</l>
                  <l>The wicked hoſt did treachery bewray:</l>

                  <l>A youth ſtood by, who came to ſee and hear,</l>

                  <l>The Judge enquir'd, if that man could be found,</l>

                  <l>Things were related as we heard already.</l>
                  <l>This fellows anſwer was as round and ſpeedy;</l>
                  <l>You hoſt, have you not there a double door</l>

                  <l>That by that means the man might be betray'd?</l>
                  <l>After ſom pauſe the hoſt curſt, ſwore, and ſaid,</l>
                  <l>The devil take my ſoul and body hence,</l>
                  <l>If there be truth in this unjuſt pretence:</l>
                  <l>I'm therefore come, (ſays th'other) I am he;</l>

                  <l>Away he goes, or rather with him flew,</l>

                  <l>His horſe on foam, the Priſoner loads with ſhame,</l>
                  <l>Said: This a Major, not a Juſtice is,</l>

                  <l>The Priſoner was a ſtranger in the place</l>

                  <l>And Major <hi>Covern</hi> was not much belov'd</l>

                  <l>He knows what will him tame (mute as a mouſe)</l>
                  <l>He took his cloke, and went with man again,</l>

                  <l>You heard before; the pris'ner rode a horſe,</l>
                  <l>Was either lent, (or hyr'd by carriers purſe)</l>

                  <l>The pris'ner durſt not ride this horſe alone,</l>
                  <l>Which might be ſeized; (being not his own)</l>
                  <l>The Juſtice undertook, he (without force)</l>

                  <l>From him that had no more: When ſtrangers came.</l>
                  <l>And at that time had many of his own,</l>
                  <l>'Gainſt this was <hi>David's</hi> zeal and fury ſhown.</l>
                  <l>Not onely ſo: but his Authority,</l>
                  <l>(As ſure as god; doth live, that man ſhall die)</l>
                  <l>Well <hi>David</hi> you have ſaid well, know you who</l>
                  <l>By ſuch a ſentence you'l at once undoe.</l>
                  <l>Tak't as thou wilt, thou art that malefactor</l>
                  <l>Thy judgement's juſt, art judge as well as actor.</l>
                  <l>Had <hi>David</hi> known at firſt, what <hi>Nathan</hi> meant</l>
                  <l>It's ſomewhat doubtful, he would not conſent</l>

                  <l>What uſe then ſhould of parables we make?</l>
                  <l>Judge things remote; ere we our ſelvs partake</l>
                  <l>Oh we can Judge right well of <hi>A. B. C.</hi>

                  <l>But Judgement's blind when't comes to thee and me,</l>
                  <l>Look at the members of a parable</l>

                  <l>And where you find, the Authors Judgement lame</l>
                  <l>Let Author (not the Scripture) bear the blame.</l>
                  <l>Where any thing; with Scripture doth agree</l>
                  <l>Reject it not; becauſe it comes from mee.</l>
                  <l>For what is good, comes from an higher hand</l>
                  <l>And will not bear (from creatures) countermand.</l>
                  <l>But if you'l ſay the Author had no call.</l>
                  <l>To medle with redemption or the fall.</l>
                  <l>Let, then the Author go; regard him not</l>
                  <l>But where the Scripture conſcience reaches pat:</l>
                  <l>Makes conſcience naked; inward parts mak's bare,</l>
                  <l>Reſiſt the Jeſt (thus handed) if you dare.</l>
                  <l>The Author feel's he is a very worm</l>

                  <l>(Of which our Prince and Son (here) onely can</l>

                  <l>Another Myſtery to be unfolded</l>
                  <l>Of as great weight, as any has been told yet:</l>
                  <l>What weapons true caeleſtians muſt uſe</l>
                  <l>Againſt the ſerpians (for they may not chuſe)</l>
                  <l>There's not a weapon uſed in our camp</l>
                  <l>But it's appointed, proved of what ſtamp:</l>
                  <l>Whether in caſe for preſent execution</l>
                  <l>If not defective (by the inſtitution)</l>
                  <l>VVe have an excellent Artillery,</l>
                  <l>As great a charge we muſt not be unwary</l>
                  <l>There's many circumſtances hereunto</l>
                  <l>Of abſolute neceſſitie to do</l>
                  <l>Our dilligence, that nothing be miſplac'd</l>
                  <l>For then (at beſt) our work will be defac'd.</l>
                  <l>Our weapons are not guns, pikes, ſwords, and ſtavs;</l>
                  <l>Our Priſons are not caſtles, holes and caves;</l>
                  <l>Our Armor is not iron ſteel and braſs;</l>
                  <l>Our Ammunition, pouder ſhot and Match;</l>
                  <l>The Punishment our Prince doth uſe t'inflict</l>
                  <l>Is not by fines, and Mulcts and interdict:</l>
                  <l>The ſerpians indeed have all theſe knacks</l>
                  <l>VVhich 'mongſt the Minorites great havockmakes</l>
                  <l>Our VVeapons are commands in Princes name;</l>
                  <l>Our Priſons, guilty conſcience and ſhame;</l>
                  <l>Our Armor, confidence in Princes word;</l>
                  <l>Our Ammunition, Threatnings from our lord,</l>
                  <l>Our puniſhment that we inflict on foes</l>
                  <l>Is, inward horror, future judgement woes</l>
                  <l>And for our conqueſt: finall deſperation</l>
                  <l>Thrown on the ſerpians with indignation.</l>
                  <l>And theſe ſo gall and vex the curſed wretches</l>
                  <l>It robs them of their ſhifts and cunning fetches</l>
                  <l>Altho they rant, they fret; they fume and ſwagger,</l>
                  <l>Yet (lighting on the gall) it makes them ſtagger:</l>
                  <l>And tho they quarrell, cavill murmure, grumble</l>
                  <l>Their wounds at laſt, wil ſurely make them tumble,</l>
                  <l>Oft I have ſeen a ſerpian fall i'th' fray</l>
                  <l>He has not had another word to ſay,</l>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47983:107"/>
                  <l>Unleſs it was to howl, roar, ſwear, and curſe,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe he knows his torments will be worſe,</l>
                  <l>Will often wiſh he knew the utmoſt pain,</l>
                  <l>But that it's endleſs that torments again.</l>
                  <l>But there's another riddle ſomwhat deeper,</l>
                  <l>That makes theſe craggy rocks appear far ſteeper,</l>
                  <l>And makes our way ambiguous confuſe,</l>
                  <l>How we ſhould fight 'gainſt whom, or hold a truce.</l>
                  <l>And here we want a curious inſpection,</l>
                  <l>Without our prince we cannot find direction;</l>
                  <l>For it is onely his plain inſtitution,</l>
                  <l>That can preſerve from error and confuſion.</l>
                  <l>We do not fight, (deſigning to deſtroy)</l>
                  <l>(Except the ſerpians) any to annoy.</l>
                  <l>Now Minorites do often intermix</l>
                  <l>In ſerpian crouds, and there the queſtion ſticks,</l>
                  <l>How we ſhall ſhoot or ſtrike and never hit,</l>
                  <l>(At leaſt to hurt) a ſingle Minorite?</l>
                  <l>For if we hurt not 'tis properly no fight,</l>
                  <l>(If not intended) though the ſtroke may light</l>
                  <l>On 20 Minorites, it will not kill,</l>
                  <l>It may indeed prove med'cinal (a pill)</l>
                  <l>That if he turn not ſerpian indeed,</l>
                  <l>Shall never hurt him tho it make him bleed.</l>
                  <l>Our ammunition is of that rare nature,</l>
                  <l>It works according to the humors matter.</l>
                  <l>Coeleſtian humors will not get a touch,</l>
                  <l>(Unleſs for pleaſure) I dare well avouch.</l>
                  <l>A Minorite no doubt may ſomwhat ſmart,</l>
                  <l>And (for his good) 'tmay ſearch his very heart.</l>
                  <l>Purge inflammations perhaps make him ſore,</l>
                  <l>But (while a Minorite) can do no more.</l>
                  <l>For (in our ſence) if Minorites be kill'd.</l>
                  <l>'Twould be a paradox was never held.</l>
                  <l>To make this plainer in ſo dark a caſe,</l>
                  <l>Natural death in our war tak's no place,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs a ſerpians conſcience terrifies,</l>
                  <l>That for the torment he fall's down and dies.</l>

                  <l>The way to free the place from ſeat of war</l>
                  <l>Is to give up, to'th' lawfull governor.</l>

                  <l>That by experience, none are gone away,</l>

                  <l>What is the mind, or ſoul (body let go)</l>
                  <l>Yet in ſome part, we have a real taſt</l>
                  <l>Experience double, in what things are paſt</l>
                  <l>How many loſe a leg, an arm, an eye,</l>
                  <l>The ſoul goes out, but is it leſs thereby?</l>
                  <l>Indeed by this it plainly doth appear</l>
                  <l>The ſoul no longer doth inhabit there,</l>
                  <l>And then that member liv's not, th'actors fled,</l>
                  <l>But who can therefore ſay that actor's dead?</l>
                  <l>It kils the member which it parteth fro,</l>
                  <l>But what kills it? what reaſoniſt can ſhow?</l>
                  <l>When once the ſoul takes leave of head and heart,</l>
                  <l>We know its gone from every other part,</l>

                  <l>It has not flitted, ſome where elſe to dwell?</l>
                  <l>But what means ſwounings, extaſies and trances,</l>
                  <l>In ſome continue long, in ſome frequencies,</l>
                  <l>They often come, ſtay long, as ſome can tell</l>

                  <l>Somtimes the body's have been ſo long dead,</l>
                  <l>That ſo appear'd, as if the ſoul was fled</l>

                  <l>When t'help it ſelf, was every way unfit,</l>

                  <l>To help the ſoul, the body had no powr,</l>

                  <l>I'ts far more likely that the life o'th'body</l>
                  <l>Is by the ſoul upheld then the contrary,</l>

                  <l>Which has moſt vertue? who can anſwer whether?</l>
                  <l>The one or other, by the nobler part</l>
                  <l>(As in the members) all give place to'th'heart.</l>

                  <l>But this is that I chiefly note it for</l>
                  <l>The ſtory which he told me (which is more,</l>

                  <l>His ſoul was in, 'ere back to'th' body came;</l>
                  <l>When friends ſaw him revive, they were right glad,</l>

                  <l>How Planet-ſtruck creaſt faln, and all a mort,</l>
                  <l>When crazy body broke off all that ſport.</l>

                  <l>If by the body, 't had not been betraid?</l>
                  <l>This yong mans name was called <hi>Robert Hardy</hi>

                  <l>Aged four and twenty, 'bout 16 hundred thirty,</l>
                  <l>As I remember, time was juſtly ſo,</l>
                  <l>Which is about fourty ſeven year's ago.</l>
                  <l>The ſecond man diſtinctly (not to huddle</l>

                  <l>A tayler liv'd in <hi>Stanford,</hi> 8 years after</l>

                  <l>This <hi>Budle</hi> as I heard (with divers others)</l>
                  <l>Was brought unto the grave by friends and brothers,</l>
                  <l>As they were buſy, him therein t'infold</l>

                  <l>The third was called <hi>druncken Will the paver</hi>

                  <l>Who had been dead (men thought) ſufficient time</l>
                  <l>No prejudice at all to bury him,</l>
                  <l>When corp's were at grave's mouth, in had been hurld</l>

                  <l>The people ran, as if they'd been ſtark mad</l>
                  <l>For fear o'th' devil (like dead <hi>Will</hi> now clad.)</l>

                  <l>Who had the habit ſtill, tho muſt refrain</l>
                  <l>To act, rather then roaſt would drink again,</l>
                  <l>And after this ſome years from <hi>Will</hi> I heard</l>
                  <l>All this confeſt (in Paving one court yard)</l>
                  <l>In <hi>Barneſtaple,</hi> (if I rightly fix)</l>
                  <l>The year was 16 hundred ſifty ſix</l>
                  <l>(Now ſeventy ſeven) by all which it appear's</l>
                  <l>From this relation one and twenty year's,</l>
                  <l>But where his ſoul had been in all the trance,</l>
                  <l>I muſt profeſs my total ignorance,</l>
                  <l>Where'ere it was, it's clear, it came again</l>
                  <l>For ought I ſaw, both ſottiſh and prophane:</l>
                  <l>By which it's plain (I ſpeak it by permiſſion)</l>
                  <l>The body's death: changes no ſouls condition;</l>

                  <l>That may confirm more fully in this matter</l>
                  <l>Whence I conclude; where ere the bodies lie</l>
                  <l>Souls are immortal, and do never die,</l>
                  <l>But do and ſhall, while bodie's dead and after</l>

                  <l>Which leavs no room by war to be decided:</l>
                  <l>The body caeleſtine remains in bliſs</l>
                  <l>By vertue of that fre'ed ſoul of his</l>

                  <l>T'is left for judgement not for fight to 'trye:</l>
                  <l>Now as caeleſtian ſouls have far more bliſſ</l>

                  <l>From what the body, formerly him lent:</l>
                  <l>His quaffing fits, and jolly company</l>
                  <l>Could once his dumps, and torments oft put by.</l>

                  <l>A farther ſecret, hidden myſtery.</l>
                  <l>By looking round about, I can not ſee</l>
                  <l>But it compriſeth two (at leaſt) of three</l>
                  <l>The firſt I can by ba means cloſe withall</l>

                  <l>But with the ſecond, I do much agree</l>
                  <l>Who judge the ſoul hath ſuch a ſympathy</l>
                  <l>With all the good and ill that bodies feell</l>
                  <l>That it can perſonate each member well</l>

                  <l>By help angelicall: or ſlight o'th devill.</l>

                  <l>The Rich mans body's taken in that ſtation</l>
                  <l>Where in it ſhall, at goal delivery</l>
                  <l>Be joind with ſoul, in all it's miſery:</l>
                  <l>Then may it well admit all in the letter</l>
                  <l>Both what is worſe, as alſo what is better,</l>
                  <l>According to the ſtate the foul is in,</l>
                  <l>Whether caeleſtian, or ſerpentine.</l>
                  <l>The third main head, I did before propound</l>
                  <l>To ſhew the ſtate of war, aſ well as ground.</l>
                  <l>Which ſeem's to me ſo clear by what is ſaid</l>
                  <l>That it was needleſs, farther there to wade.</l>
                  <l>Yet ſecond thoughts, have made ſome alteration</l>
                  <l>Chiefly for preſſing home the application</l>

                  <l>To touch the quick: and ſay, thou art the man,</l>
                  <l>Which every conſcience, better can deſery</l>

                  <l>In every Minorite there is a flaw</l>

                  <l>I will appeal to your originall.</l>
                  <l>If you review, what here to fore was ſaid</l>
                  <l>You'l find, at firſt, you were uprightly made</l>
                  <l>Had all things given for your chiefeſt good</l>
                  <l>With all ſupplies, for ſafety and for food.</l>
                  <l>Nothing your Prince with held, except one tree</l>
                  <l>Which he preſerved for his royaltie</l>

                  <l>That tree tipes out (in ſhort) a double band</l>

                  <l>The firſt reply, that to this charge was made</l>
                  <l>Was utterly, the conſcience, to evade</l>

                  <l>They were perſwaded, all was but a cheat.</l>
                  <l>That conſcience, was a falſe decietful teſt</l>

                  <l>Who dare oppoſe, the teſt of conſcience?</l>
                  <l>And how you him, and conſcience have obeyd</l>

                  <l>Without ſome ſmart, reluctancie, and fear</l>
